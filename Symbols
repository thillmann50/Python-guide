* multiply. Also use to unpack a tuple. s = sum(*values)

** to the power of. Also use to unpack a dictionary. s = sum(**values)

// truncating division (e.g. "4.0 // 1.5" gives 2.0)

( ) Brackets for variables etc.

[ ] brackets for Lists

+= "x = x + 2" is the same as "x += 2"

-= "x = x - 2" is the same as "x -= 2"

*= "x = x * 2" is the same as "x *= 2"

/= "x = x / 2" is the same as "x /= 2"

**= "x = x ** 2" is the same as "x **= 2"

//= "x = x // 2" is the same as "x //= 2"

%=	"x = x % 2" is the same as "x %= 2"
